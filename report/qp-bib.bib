@article{dedecker:fan:2015,
	Abstract = {We consider an X-valued Markov chain X1,X2,{\ldots},Xn belonging to a class of iterated random functions, which is ``one-step contracting'' with respect to some distance d on X. If f is any separately Lipschitz function with respect to d, we use a well known decomposition of Sn=f(X1,{\ldots},Xn)−E[f(X1,{\ldots},Xn)] into a sum of martingale differences dk with respect to the natural filtration Fk. We show that each difference dk is bounded by a random variable ηk independent of Fk−1. Using this very strong property, we obtain a large variety of deviation inequalities for Sn, which are governed by the distribution of the ηk's. Finally, we give an application of these inequalities to the Wasserstein distance between the empirical measure and the invariant distribution of the chain.},

@inproceedings{kondor:trivedi:2018a,
	Abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have been extremely successful in the image recognition domain because they ensure equivariance with respect to translations. There have been many recent attempts to generalize this framework to other domains, including graphs and data lying on manifolds. In this paper we give a rigorous, theoretical treatment of convolution and equivariance in neural networks with respect to not just translations, but the action of any compact group. Our main result is to prove that (given some natural constraints) convolutional structure is not just a sufficient, but also a necessary condition for equivariance to the action of a compact group. Our exposition makes use of concepts from representation theory and noncommutative harmonic analysis and derives new generalized convolution formulae.},
